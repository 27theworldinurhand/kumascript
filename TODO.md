TODO
----

* Implement the HTTP service

* Handle document "syntax errors" gracefully

* Handle template-not-found errors gracefully

* Switch doc parser from PEG.js to [Jison][]?
    * Not that there's a known problem, but CoffeeScript uses Jison.
    * PEG grammar is much more readable, though, IMO.
